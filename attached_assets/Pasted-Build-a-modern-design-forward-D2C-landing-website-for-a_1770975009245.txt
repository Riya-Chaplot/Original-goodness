Build a modern, design-forward D2C landing website for a premium functional indulgence food brand.
The website should feel culturally sharp, indie, typography-led, and visually confident — similar in energy to modern challenger consumer brands like Misfits or Olipop — but DO NOT copy any existing layouts, graphics, or branding. Create an original design with the same level of boldness and visual impact.
The site must feel like a venture-backed consumer startup — not a generic Shopify wellness store.
Prioritize editorial design, oversized typography, strong grid systems, negative space, and high-contrast sections.
Avoid anything that feels corporate, templated, overly friendly, or “healthy-food beige.”
This brand is modern, functional, indulgent, and built for high-performing urban consumers.

DESIGN DIRECTION
Create a visually striking interface with:
* Oversized bold headlines
* Editorial-style layout
* Asymmetrical grid sections
* Large product visuals
* Smooth scrolling
* Subtle micro-animations
* Strong whitespace
* Minimal clutter
Typography should carry the brand.
Use a combination of:
* a modern grotesk sans-serif for impact
* a refined serif for contrast
The aesthetic should feel closer to a fashion brand than a food startup.

COLOR SYSTEM
Use a warm but premium palette:
Base tones:
* toasted cream
* almond beige
* soft honey
* muted pistachio
* deep cocoa
Accent tones:
* saffron gold
* forest green
* dark chocolate
Avoid neon colors or tech-style gradients.
No clinical greens.
No ayurvedic browns.
No startup blues.
The site should feel rich and tactile.

HERO SECTION (VERY IMPORTANT)
Full-screen hero.
Large typography.
Minimal text.
Create an emotionally powerful opening line:
“Functional. But make it indulgent.”
Subtext:
Modern cakes crafted with functional ingredients — designed for your mood, mind, and momentum.
Primary CTA: 👉 Shop First Drop
Secondary CTA: 👉 Join Early Access
Display the three products floating or stacked with dramatic lighting and soft shadows.
The hero should immediately signal this is NOT a typical health brand.

PRODUCT ARCHITECTURE SECTION
Create a bold section introducing the three mental-state products.
Use large typography for the state names.

PRODUCT 1
ZEN MODE Honey Vanilla Ashwagandha + Saffron
Tagline: Soft bite. Quiet mind.
Short descriptor: Made to take the edge off — without taking you off your game.

PRODUCT 2
LOCKED IN Pistachio Elaichi Spirulina + Moringa
Tagline: Sharp mind. No crash.
Short descriptor: Clean cognitive fuel disguised as dessert.

PRODUCT 3
CHARGED (Use this instead of saying shilajit loudly) Dark Chocolate Truffle Mineral adaptogens
Tagline: Energy that lasts. Not spikes.
Short descriptor: Deep, sustained energy built for long days.

Each product should appear as a bold card with:
* Large typography
* Ingredient highlights
* Flavor name
* Quick benefit
* Hover animation
Make the section feel premium and editorial.

BRAND PHILOSOPHY SECTION
Large typography statement:
“Your snacks should keep up with your life.”
Supporting copy:
No refined flour. No artificial flavors. No unnecessary additives.
Just intelligent indulgence.

DIFFERENTIATION SECTION
Create a visually strong grid explaining the brand:
* Functional ingredients
* Craveable flavors
* No jittery energy
* No compromise
Keep copy punchy — no long paragraphs.

SOCIAL PROOF / FUTURE SPACE
Leave a placeholder for:
“As seen in” or “Trusted by high performers”
Do not fabricate logos.

EMAIL CAPTURE
Create a strong early-access block:
Headline:
“First batch won’t last.”
Subtext:
Join the list for priority access.
Field: Email + phone optional.
CTA: 👉 Get Priority Access

FOOTER
Minimal.
Logo Social links Contact Copyright
No clutter.

UX REQUIREMENTS
Mobile-first design.
Fast loading.
Premium feel.
Smooth scrolling.
No heavy effects that reduce performance.
The site should feel expensive but effortless.

BRAND PERSONALITY
Confident. Modern. Intelligent. Design-led. Slightly rebellious.
Never loud. Never gimmicky. Never try-hard.
This should feel like the homepage of a future category leader.
