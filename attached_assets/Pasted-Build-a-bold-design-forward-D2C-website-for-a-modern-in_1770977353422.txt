Build a bold, design-forward D2C website for a modern indulgent food brand called:

OG – Original Goodness

OG is a premium, culturally sharp, design-led brand that creates smarter indulgent foods.

The first product category is called:

Supercakes

The website must feel like a high-growth, venture-backed consumer brand. It should be typography-led, editorial, minimal, and confident — similar in energy to modern indie challenger brands — but completely original in layout, visuals, and branding.

Do NOT copy any existing brand.

This should feel premium, bold, and culturally relevant.

BRAND POSITIONING

OG stands for Original Goodness.

It represents upgraded indulgence — food that tastes indulgent but is built with intelligent ingredients.

The tone is:

Confident
Modern
Slightly rebellious
Premium
Design-forward
Not wellness-beige
Not corporate
Not ayurvedic
